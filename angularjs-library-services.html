<p>This article provides an introduction to the JavaScript framework AngularJS and specific AngularJS modules for accessing library services. It shows how information such as search suggestions, additional links, and availability can be embedded in any website. The ease of reuse may encourage more libraries to expose their services via standard APIs to allow usage in different context.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The demand to open up library systems through web services has been known since years <span class="citation">(Breeding 2009)</span>. In particular service-oriented architecture (SOA) promised to better allow a continuous evolution of library automation and to better connect with external systems. Nevertheless current library systems are rarely build of loosely coupled parts that could be used independently. The background of this abidance on monolithical systems must be discussed elsewhere. One reason might be a lack of motivation to provide library services via open APIs.</p>
<h2 id="library-services-and-apis">Library services and APIs</h2>
<p>Services provided by a library or similar institution should be easy to use by anyone and in any form. Most services, however, can only be used in the fixed context of a particular user interface. If a service can be accessed via application programming interface (API), it can also be integrated and used in other applications. Nevertheless there is a lack of motivation to expose services via open APIs.</p>
<p>User interfaces are curated and revised by usability studies and user experience (UX) at best. In other instances the UI is simply judged with common sense by normal library staff and management. APIs on the other hand, cannot simply be viewed, used, and judged by anyone. Unlike the UI, an API is not a final application to make use of a service, but the basis for creation of service applications: Without APIs, applications are difficult to build and services can only be provided in limited form. Without applications, however, it is difficult to justify the need for an API.</p>
<p>To give an example, most library systems lack an API to query current availability of documents held by the library. As long as information about current availability was only displayed in local library OPACs there was little motivation to create a public API. With the need to display availability information in discovery interfaces such as VuFind, the Document Availability Information API (<a href="http://purl.org/NET/DAIA">DAIA</a>) was specified and implemented at GBV <span class="citation">(“Document Availability Information API (DAIA)”)</span>. But little interest was shown by other libraries and system vendors as long as they did not require the API for internal use. The full benefit of an open API is not revealed until different applications by different parties make use of it. This article will demonstrate a possible strategy to increase visibility and use of library APIs by providing client modules that facilitate the creation of applications by third parties. The modules are based on the JavaScript framework AngularJS which is getting more and more popular among developers of web applications. The general strategy is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<h1 id="angularjs">AngularJS</h1>
<p><a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is a web application framework based on JavaScript and HTML. AngularJS aims to enhance the functionality of JavaScript, specifically by providing features supporting modularisation and testing. Structurally, the framework is based on “modules”, which contain the application logic and have to be included via an HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-tag.</p>
<p><em>general overview of AngularJS (how it works, strength, alternatives…)</em></p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.13/angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The first tool for facilitating usability is the promotion of discrete submodules, in which different behaviors can be defined seperately of each other. These “directives” can then be easily reused on their own in different applications. They are also a tool for seperating server side logic from client views, accomplished through a practical template solution. AngularJS supports the inclusion of html-code via those templates, which can be assigned unique scopes - again to promote the reduction of dependencies. Combined with this functionality, the framework provides built-in two-way data binding. This in turn adds a lot of options for HTML coding, like the possibility to display variable values, automatically updated during runtime (Angular provides its curly bracket <code>{{}}</code> syntax to this end). Furthermore, AngularJS provides methods for including basic programming syntax into HTML, like conditionals and loops (<code>ng-if</code> and <code>ng-repeat</code>, respectively), which can simply be used as HTML attributes.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html ng-app=&quot;myApp&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    angular.module(&#39;myApp&#39;, []);
    function MyController($scope){
        $scope.data = [
            { id: &quot;123&quot;, value: &quot;foo&quot; },
            { id: &quot;345&quot;, value: &quot;bar&quot; },
            { value: &quot;text&quot; }
        ]
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body ng-controller=&quot;MyController&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul ng-repeat=&quot;d in data&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li ng-if=&quot;d.id&quot;&gt;{{d.value}}&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    ...
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>will display every index-item <code>value</code> of the <code>data</code> scope, if the subfield <code>data.id</code> exists for the specific item. So <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> would be added to the list. Combined with the option to reuse other prebuilt modules, this greatly enriches the possibilities of DOM-manipulation. Many useful modules can be found at <a href="http://ngmodules.org/">http://ngmodules.org/</a>.</p>
<h1 id="modules-for-embedding-library-services">Modules for embedding library services</h1>
<p>The practical embedding of library services in websites with AngularJS is illustrated in the following with two examples. Both are available as AngularJS modules for easy reuse: the ng-suggest module provides access to search suggestions and links <span class="citation">(“Ng-Suggest” 2014)</span> and the ng-daia module provides access to availability information <span class="citation">(Voß and Horn 2014)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="suggestions-with-ng-suggest">Suggestions with ng-suggest</h2>
<p>The OpenSearch standard for search engines includes a specification for how to query search suggestions and autocomplete services via HTTP <span class="citation">(Clinton 2006)</span>. Suggestion services are provided by many search applications as “typeahead”. The method can also be used for instance by recommendation services <span class="citation">(Voß 2008)</span> and to support support tagging with controlled vocabularies <span class="citation">(Nagaya et al. 2011)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="typeahead.jpg" alt="Typeahead via OpenSearch Suggestions" /><p class="caption">Typeahead via OpenSearch Suggestions</p>
</div>
<p>The OpenSearch Suggestions specification defines a query response as JSON array with at least two elements (query string and a list of search completions):</p>
<pre><code>[
    &quot;Moz&quot;,
    [&quot;mozilla&quot;,&quot;mozilla firefox&quot;,&quot;mozart&quot;,&quot;mozilla thunderbird&quot;,...]
]</code></pre>
<p>Optional elements can include descriptions and URLs for each search completion. While processing of this simple format is not very complex, it still requires JavaScript skills to make use of a suggestion service. ng-suggest simplifies the embedding to two HTML statements. The following example enriches an input form with typeahead from Wikipedia as depicted in the figure below:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;html ng-app=&quot;myApp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;..lib/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;..lib/angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;..lib/angular-sanitize.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;..lib/ui-bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;..lib/ui-bootstrap-tpls.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;../src/ng-suggest.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    ...
    &lt;body ng-controller=&quot;myController&quot;&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    angular.module(&#39;myApp&#39;, [&#39;ui.bootstrap&#39;,&#39;ngSuggest&#39;]);
    function myController($scope){
        $scope.example = { 
            api: &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&amp;limit=10&amp;namespace=0&amp;format=json&amp;search=&quot;,
            input: &quot;&quot;,
            item: &quot;&quot;
        };
        $scope.example.onSelect = function(item){
            $scope.example.item = item;
        };
    };
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;input style=&quot;width:400px&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot;
        typeahead-on-select=&quot;example.onSelect($item)&quot;
        ng-model=&quot;example.input&quot;
        suggest-typeahead=&quot;example.api&quot; jsonp=1
        placeholder=&quot;Search Wikipedia&quot;
    /&gt;
    
    ...
    
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="suggest_wikipedia_en.png" alt="Suggest Wikipedia articles with ng-suggest" /><p class="caption">Suggest Wikipedia articles with ng-suggest</p>
</div>
<p>Similar suggestions can be provided for any Open Search Suggestions service by just changing the service’s base URL. Among other features, responses can be embedded as simple lists (for instance related documents and related publications), and different JSON response formats can be mapped.</p>
<h2 id="availability-with-ng-daia">Availability with ng-daia</h2>
<p>DAIA defines a data model and an HTTP API for accessing information about the current availability of documents. Its aim is to provide a way for libraries to allow open and easy-to-use access to holding information from their catalogs. This, in turn, enables the inclusion of document availability information in external applications and websites. Among other formats, DAIA provides availability information in JSON, the first choice for web applications written in JavaScript. The AngularJS module ng-daia implements client code to execute and process a DAIA query and to display holding information in convenient form. The integration into HTML is exemplarily documented in the following code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html ng-app=&quot;myApp&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;ng-daia.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;angular.module(&#39;myApp&#39;, [&#39;ngDAIA&#39;]);&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link href=&quot;ng-daia.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div daia-api=&quot;http://your-daia-base-url&quot; daia-id=&quot;your-document-id&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>ng-daia is hosted in a public git repository, documented and downloadable at <a href="http://gbv.github.io/ng-daia/">http://gbv.github.io/ng-daia/</a>. The module utilizes its directives to query a DAIA server and transform the received object to control the displaying of specific parts of information. To achieve a compact structure, there are different directives for the response as a whole, a single item of the result and the information concerning its current availability. The availability of documents in DAIA is split into several independent services (openaccess, loan, interloan and presentation), which can be reflected in the implementation. Furthermore, <code>daia-simple</code> defines an additional format provided by this module, providing the most preferable status for any single item of the result and displaying the available service in a short form. Included are standard templates, which make use of the in-HTML logic features of AngularJS such as <code>ng-if</code> and <code>ng-repeat</code>. The output using these templates may look like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="ngdaia_demo_EN_full.png" alt="example output of ng-daia with standard templates" /><p class="caption">example output of ng-daia with standard templates</p>
</div>
<p>In this example you can see the nested structure of the DAIA data model, which consists of an outer layer for institutional and document information as a whole. The document object contains one or more items, which can be further attributed to departments of the holding institution or a location (e.g. shelf mark). Within each item object, the availability for specific services is enclosed, as well as limitations and further options for those services (such as reserving a currently lent physical copy). The filter <code>daia-simple</code> would in this example return an object with a field <code>status: 'loan'</code>, as loan is currently the most preferable available service. In addition, the templates provide localization capabilities using <a href="http://angular-translate.github.io/">angular-translate</a>.</p>
<p>Utilizing this tool will allow website creators to easily embedd either current information concerning a specific document, or providing a way to request availability information from multiple sources.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>AngularJS modules, such as ng-suggest and ng-daia presented above, provide an easy method to integrate library services in websites and applications. A basic prequisite to support use of a library service, however, is the availability of an HTTP-based API to this service. Despite existing efforts to open library systems (e.g. the <a href="http://old.diglib.org/architectures/ilsdi/">ILS-DI Recommendations</a> and <a href="www.oclc.org/developer/webservices">WorldCat Web Services</a>) the support of standard APIs in library systems is non-satisfying. Apart from search via SRU and resource synchronization via OAI-PMH, most library services are not provided via an API at all, or the API is specific to the underlying library system only, or it is very complex and only available for internal use (e.g. NCIP). The lack of available APIs, however, is not a technical problem but a problem of motivation to specify, implement, provide, and document these APIs. The examples of how to integrate library services in arbitrary web applications, given in this article, may at least add some motivation to provide library services via open APIs.</p>
<p>Even if AngularJS is or will not be the technology of your choice, the principle illustrated in the initial diagram above makes sense. Libraries should not only expose their services via openly specified APIs but also provide client libraries to facilitate the integration of these services into web applications. To minimize the work of doing so, one should build on standardized APIs instead of (re)inventing new APIs for every library system.</p>
<p><em>…lessons learned: development of an API and an API client as AngularJS module is fruitful…</em></p>
<p>Candidates for most missing AngularJS modules to access library services: SRU and/or OpenSearch (see http://dlib.org/dlib/july10/hammond/07hammond.html for a description/example of both).</p>
<p><em>…If no common API exists, one must specify one… for instance at GBV we are evaluating APIs to access controlled vocabularies expressed in SKOS (ng-skos)…</em></p>
<p><em>…some final words…</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Notes maybe to include in the article text:</em></p>
<p>A third example can be found as work in progress at <a href="https://github.com/gbv/ng-skos">https://github.com/gbv/ng-skos</a>. <strong>ng-skos</strong> is a module to interact with authority files and other simple knowledge organisation systems (SKOS).</p>
<p>As is the philosophy of AngularJS easily implementable and reusable solution to this problem. It retrieves the suggestions of a specified service and, using the <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap UI</a>, provides a typeahead function for web applications.</p>
<p>How can the vicious circle of missing APIs to library services be broken?</p>
<p>(this article is based on the assumption that libraries actually want to facilitate the use of their servics. In some cases this assumption might be wrong).</p>
<p>an easy way how library services, if available in form of APIs, can be exposed, used and integrated into other web applications.</p>
